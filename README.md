AsteroidsTest
=============

Asteroids! near-clone and various mini-programs I made while learning how to code it.

I made this program before receiving any formal training in software development.
    In its current form these files need some help before they can be used as
    a coding reference (though the game works great).
    
Requires Python 3 and Pygame for Python 3, though it should be easy enough to
    adapt to Python 2 and the associated Pygame version if desired.
